;;It would be nice to easily configure sc2 game environments
;;this to facilitate data collection for
;; - Agent performance (think automatic generated minigame)
;; - API data output analysis (think "what does casting storm do to a bunch of clumped up marines")
;; - Collecting estimator data. (think "what does my mineral income look like with this build order?")
